### Discussion

Use the information captured by this instrument to inspect your app's React Native bridge calls. The busier the bridge, the less responsive your app is likely to be.

### Detail Pane

The detail pane includes your app's React Native bridge counters at the time of the sample; N➔JS (native to JavaScript) and JS➔N (JavaScript to native) are displayed in columns of delta as well as total.
