<title>The Recording Document</title>
<meta name="description" content="A recording document is used to initiate new profiling and view and analyze the results of profiling. You create a new recording document by selecting **File** ➔ **New Recording...** and choosing an app-device pair to profile. You can also save and reopen recording documents in which you’ve collected data previously. A recording document can contain a lot of extremely detailed information, and this information is presented to you through a number of panes and areas." />
